async def process_speech(request):
    speech = await get_speech_from_twilio(request)

    # Gemini understands intent
    intent = await gemini.parse(speech)

    # If search needed, call Maps
    if intent.needs_search:
        results = await maps.search(
            query=intent.query,
            location=intent.location
        )

    # Format natural response
    response = await gemini.format(results)
