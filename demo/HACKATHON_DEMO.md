## 🎬 Pro Demo Tips

### Before the Call
1. **Prime the location** - Have a specific city/area chosen (McGill/Montreal works great)
2. **Test the query** - Run it once to verify results
3. **Have backup** - Record a successful call video
4. **Show logs** - Terminal window with real-time API calls

### During the Demo
1. **Speak clearly** - Twilio speech recognition needs good audio
2. **Pause for effect** - Let AI responses finish
3. **Show SMS** - Have phone visible for text arrival
4. **Explain as you go** - "Notice how it remembered my location"

### After the Demo
```python
# Show this code snippet:
@app.post("/voice/process-speech")
async def process_speech():
    # User speaks → Twilio transcribes
    speech = form_data.get('SpeechResult')

    # Gemini understands intent
    response = await llm_service.process_message(speech)

    # If search needed, call Maps API
    if response['type'] == 'function_call':
        places = maps_service.search_places(
            query=response['function_args']['query'],
            location=response['function_args']['location']
        )

    # Return natural language via TwiML
    return generate_twiml(formatted_response)
```

## 🚀 Secret Sauce: What Makes This Special

1. **Zero Friction**
   - No app download
   - No account creation
   - Just dial and talk

2. **Context Intelligence**
   ```python
   # The AI remembers:
   session['location'] = "Palo Alto"
   session['last_query'] = "Asian food"
   session['preferences'] = ["budget-friendly", "open now"]

   # So follow-ups work naturally:
   "What about something cheaper?" → Uses cached context
   ```

3. **Multi-Modal Output**
   ```
   Voice: Quick answer (while on call)
   SMS: Detailed info (to save/share)
   ```

4. **Smart Defaults**
   ```python
   # Automatically adds:
   - open_now=True (it's 10 PM)
   - radius=5000m (reasonable driving distance)
   - rank_by='prominence' (quality matters)
   ```

## 💡 Bonus: Live Coding Challenge

If judges want to see adaptability:

**Challenge:** "Add weather information to the response"

**Live code (2 minutes):**
```python
# Add to services/weather_service.py
import requests

def get_weather(location: str) -> dict:
    # Use Google Maps Geocoding
    coords = maps_service.geocode_address(location)

    # Call weather API (OpenWeather)
    weather = requests.get(
        f"api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather",
        params={"lat": coords['lat'], "lon": coords['lng']}
    ).json()

    return {
        "temp": weather['main']['temp'],
        "condition": weather['weather'][0]['description']
    }

# Update LLM response
response = f"It's {weather['temp']}°F and {weather['condition']}.
            Here are restaurants nearby..."
```

**Result:** Show how modular architecture enables rapid feature addition
